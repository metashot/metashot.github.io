## Getting started

### Dependencies

MetaShot requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (or
[Singularity](https://singularity.lbl.gov/)) and [Nextflow](nextflow.io). If you
want to use Singularity instead of Docker, comment the Docker lines in the
`nextflow.config` file (which is present in each workflow and add the following:

```nextflow
singularity.enabled = true
singularity.autoMounts = true
```

Alternatively, you can provide an extra configuration file by using the command
line option `-c <config_file>`.
